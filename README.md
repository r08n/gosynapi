Synology API wrapper in Go

Since I own Synology products and try to learn go, I started this repository :-)

I would like to build a reusable library of encapsulated API calls to DSM and SRM products.

Currently I am still trying to understand all the topics - the Synology APIs, Go and Git/Github. Therefore I beg your pardon if implementation could be better or things have to be reimplemented as my understanding progresses. 

Please do not hesitate to contribute! Either in code or know-how on how things could be better build :-)

Especially I have to thank the authors of https://github.com/google/go-github. I could learn from and reuse quite a lot of their implementation!
