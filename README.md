Synology API wrapper in Go

Since I own Synology products and try to learn go, I started this repository :-)

I would like to build a reusable library of encapsulated API calls to DSM and SRM products.

Currently I am still trying to understand all, the Synology APIs, Go and Git/Github - therefore there is nothing usabel yet in this repository, but keep coming back for progress and contribution!
